# React native estate app

This is just a my very first simple demo of react-native. There aren't any interesting features in this demo, just to learn how to use react-native and expo's ecosystem

## Tech stack

- React native
- Expo
- Clerk
- Expo packages
  - Expo Haptics: Add vibration to the item when press

## Feature

- Authentication: using Clerk

## What I learnt

- Using 'react-native-reanimated' library
- Using 'react-native-bottom-sheet' library
- Remember to add 'flex: 1' to the wrapper element
- Using `mesure()` method to get the location of the `View`. This is similar to `getBoundingClientRect`
- Using `Dimension.get('window').width` to get the width of window
- Using `<ScrollView horizontal />` for simple horizontal slide
- Using route as `modal`
