# React native estate app

This is my first demo app using react native and expo.

## Tech stack

- React native
- Expo
- Clerk
- Expo packages
  - Expo Haptics: Add vibration to the item when press

## Feature

- Authentication: using Clerk

## What I learnt

- Methods
  - Using `mesure()` method to get the location of the `View`. This is similar to `getBoundingClientRect`
  - Using `Dimension.get('window').width` to get the width of window
